This term project program is about building a bridge over a river. 
 + You can choose different material to build it and get your bridge diagnosis after you have vehicles run over it.
 + The most fun part is that you can rotate the gameboard and see your car running accross your bridge from different angle.
 + That's all about TKinter! I made my own 3D engine in TKinter!
 + Have a look at a rough demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjNW_OTk1sM
#Need numpy library to run this game.
